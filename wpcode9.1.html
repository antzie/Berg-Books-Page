           <p>
             The rebellious son of a long line of pureblood cartographers and
             diviners, Valen has spent most of his life trying to escape what
             society -- and his family -- have ordained for him. His own mother
             has predicted that he will meet his doom in water, blood, and ice.
             Her divination seems fulfilled when a comrade abandons Valen in a
             rainy wilderness half-dead, addicted to an enchantment that converts
             pain to pleasure, and possessing only a stolen book of maps.
           </p>
           <p>
             Offered sanctuary in a nearby monastery, Valen discovers that his
             book -- rumoured to lead men into the realm of angels -- gains him
             entry into a world of secret societies, doomsayers, monks, princes,
             and madmen, all seeking to unlock the mystery of a coming dark age.
             To his dismay, Valen must face what he fled so long ago, for the key
             to Navronne's doom is buried in half-forgotten myth and the secrets
             of his own past...

          Took a little while to get going, this book was mostly set-up for the
          second part of the duology and yet, and yet... it was riveting. Interesting
          characters, interesting world, interesting story and beautifully writen.
          Valen's trajectory from a self-absorbed, hedonistic yet charming almost
          (but not quite) anti-hero to almost (but not quite) hero was skillfully
          done.

              As the land of Navronne sinks deeper into civil war and perilous
              winter, everyone wants to get their hands on the rebellious sorcerer
              Valen -a murderous priestess, a prince who steals dead men's eyes,
              and even the Danae guardians, whose magic nurtures the earth and
              whose attention could prove the most costly of all..
            </p>
            <p>
              Addicted to an enchantment that turns pain into pleasure -and bound by
              oaths he refuses to abandon- Valen risks body and soul to rescue one
              child, seek justice for another, and bring the dying land its rightful
              king.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet no one is who they seem, and Valen's search for healing grace
              leads him from Harrower dungeons to alien shores. Only at the heart
              of the world does he discover the glorious, terrible price of the
              land's redemption-and his own

            An extremely satisfactory conclusion to the duology. All loose ends neatily and
            (surprisingly for most authors) logically tied up. The plot twists were
            twists, the surprises were surprises and the story while not <em> original</em>
            was handled masterfully in such a way that it appeared original.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Note:</em> A big deal is made in the descriptions of Valen's
            addiction; while an interesting storyline it is not quite so important
            as the synopses would have you believe.

                How much must one pay for an hour of youthful folly?
                The Pureblood Registry accused Lucian de Remeni-Masson of
                “unseemly involvement with ordinaries,” which meant only that he
                spoke with a young woman not of his own kind, allowed her to
                see his face unmasked, worked a bit of magic for her....
                After that one mistake, Lucian’s grandsire excised half his
                magic and savage Harrowers massacred his family. Now the
                Registry has contracted his art to a common coroner. His
                extraordinary gift for portraiture is restricted to dead
                ordinaries—beggars or starvelings hauled from the streets.
              </p>
              <p>
                But sketching the truth of dead men’s souls brings unforeseen
                consequences. Sensations not his own. Truths he cannot possibly
                know and dares not believe. The coroner calls him a cheat and
                says he is trying to weasel out of a humiliating contract. The
                Registry will call him mad—and mad sorcerers are very dangerous....

              While Valen and company were saving the world in the Lighthouse Duet,
              in another part of Navaronne, another person was saving the world from
              a connected threat. The new protagonist, Lucian
              is quite different from Valen, while Valen had no obviously strong 'talent'
              and found the conventions of Pureblood life suffocating, Lucian is a
              very 'talented' painter and loves nothing more than pursuing his 'art'
              which, naturally, is more than it seems and, despite his strenuous
              efforts to the contrary, leads him into all sorts of trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like Flesh and Spirit the book takes a while to get going; the first
              section focuses on a number of 'small' mysteries that lay the foundations
              for the 'large' mysteries of the rest of the book (and its sequel).
              This first section where the coroner, Bastian, runs around with Lucian
              trailing along behind, solving these mysteries is probably the most
              enjoyable part of the book and once the focus changes to the main
              mysteries, it is not <em> quite</em> as fun.

              Would love this to be series of murder solving mysteries. Still

              protagonists.

                  Ever since the Order of the Equites Cineré stole his memory,
                  his name, and his heart, thinking about the past makes Greenshank’s
                  head ache. After two years of rigorous training, he is almost
                  ready to embrace the mission of the Order—to use selfless magic
                  to heal the troubles of Navronne. But on his first assignment
                  alone, the past comes racing back, threatening to drown him in
                  conspiracy, grief, and murder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He is Lucian de Remeni—a sorcerer whose magical bents for
                  portraiture and history threaten the safety of the earth and
                  the future of the war-riven kingdom of Navronne. He just can’t
                  remember how or why.
                  Fighting to unravel the mysteries of his power, Lucian must
                  trace threads of corruption that reach from the Pureblood
                  Registry into the Order itself, the truth hidden two centuries
                  in the past and beyond the boundaries of the world...

              <p>
                Like most Carol Berg's stories excellently plotted and yet...
                it had at least one annoying flaw; (slight spoiler) we are <em> told</em>
                Lucian is powerful and yet we are never <em> shown</em> that he is (actually, we are shown the opposite);
                except at the very end and even then...that left a little to be desired.
                Finally the ending itself was a little unsatisfactory - are we expected to believe Lucian is
                <em> happy</em>?! After... after!? Still a good story though.
